# Spring Framework Practice

This repository contains my **Spring Framework learning code and practice examples**, written while understanding Spring fundamentals in depth.
The codebase includes **multiple independent examples**, each focused on practicing a specific Spring concept.

This repository focuses only on **Spring Framework**.  
Spring Boot practice code is maintained in a **separate repository**.

- Each folder contains **practice code for a specific concept**
- Examples are mostly independent of each other
- Code is written to focus on clarity and understanding

---
## 🛠 How This Code Was Practiced

All practice code in this repository was written using **Eclipse IDE** by creating **separate Maven projects** for each concept.

Each Maven project is used to experiment with and understand specific Spring features, which is why the repository contains multiple independent folders and `pom.xml` files.

---
## 🎯 Purpose
- Strengthen Spring fundamentals
- Practice concepts through code
- Use as a reference for revision
- Prepare for interviews before moving to Spring Boot

## 📝 Note
I started learning Spring using normal Java projects.  
Later, I used **Maven projects for most (about 90%) of the implementations**, as Maven is commonly used in industry.
